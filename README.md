                       WATERSEER -free water from atmosphere 
 ABSTRACT:
An   water   seer    is   a   device   that   collects   water   by   promoting   the condensation of   moisture from   the air. Design  for  air wells are many  and varied, but  the simplest designs   are  completely  passive ,require  no external energy  source and  have few, if any,  moving  parts.  All   air well designs incorporate a substrate with a temperature sufficiently low so that dew forms.  Dew is  a  form  of  precipitation  that  occurs  naturally  when  atmospheric  water  vapour   condenses  onto a  substrate.   It is distinct   from fog, in that fog is made of droplets of water that condenses around particles in air. Condenses   releases latent heat which must be dissipated in order for collection of water to continue.  An air well requires moisture from the air. An air well should not be confused with dew pond. 
INTRODUCTION:
Water seer is a low –tech, low-cost, atmospheric water condenser that could help create water self-sufficiency in communities around the world. The water seer is reliably  simple device, designed  to be operated  without an external power input, and without the need  for costly  chemicals or maintenance, that can pull moisture from thin air  and condense it  into water using temperature difference  between the above-ground turbine and the collection chamber installed six feet underground.  The portable water can then be delivered to the surface for use via a simple pump and hose, and the device is said to be able to  produce up to 11 gallons per day, even in arid regions.
OBJECTIVE:
Water seer is powered by a simple wind turbine, and the device could easily be the first step towards a sustainable, enduring solution to the water shortage around the world . The water seer device is planted six or more feet into the ground and soil is then packed around its metal neck pulls the pure drinking water.
METHODOLOGY:
The water seer device is planted in the ground to the depth of six feet or more, and the soil in then packed tightly around it and up to the metal neck of the device. The top of the water seer  holds a wind turbine that turns internal  metal fan blades that draw air into the below –ground collection chamber. The subterranean part of the water seer is cooled by the surrounding soil, causing the warm air sucked into the chamber to condense, creating an artificial well of the water that people are to draw up any time they need some clean water. Because the water seer chamber is inserted into a sleeve underground, it is easily removed for cleaning. Testing has been done that shows the water in the collection chamber to be virtually free of particulates over a period and cleaner than rainwater. 
WORKING:
A three-bladed  vertical turbine on top of the device  spins in the wind driving a second fan in the body of machine
The second fan directs relatively warm air from the source into the condensation chamber buried 6 feet underground.
A filter prevents insects and debris from entering the pipe so they don’t contaminate  the harvested water
As the air cools liquid beads on the sides of the condensation  chamber which locals can make from any available materials
A hand-operator pump-no electricity required-raise the liquid which is even cleaner than tap water to the surface
BUDGET  : approximately    Rs.10000.
                   
                 
ADVANTAGES:

Low cost 
No need of external power supply.
Simple and easy to implement.

CONCLUSION:
              Water Scarcity is increasing day by day, degrading human survival.To overcome this, there exists a process water seer which gives a pure water i.e, more pure than rain water by collecting air from the atmosphere and condensing it into pure water. This can be implemented in any areas like forest, desert, urban areas and rural areas.
